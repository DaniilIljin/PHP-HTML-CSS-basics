### Basics of web development Course

---
During this course we worked with PHP, HTML and CSS

During this course we had our usual exercises (for example "ex1")
and our main project. Our project consists of: folders: "tpl" and "vendor", and files that located in Root folder.
Unfortunately, functionality doesn't work, because it still connected to teachers database.
